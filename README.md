# Small example page to illustrate some shortcode problems

This is a small example of some problems regarding shortcodes in the [Hugo Relearn Theme](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn).

The output of this page can be found at: https://fantasyteddy.github.io/relearn-shortcodes/

## Illustrated Problems

1. Is it correct that an additional shortcode is required to include Markdown as well as other shortcodes inside an `expand` shortcode?<br/>
   (see [markdown.html](layouts/shortcodes/markdown.html) shortcode)
2. Displaying a Mermaid diagram inside the `expand` shortcode does not work.
